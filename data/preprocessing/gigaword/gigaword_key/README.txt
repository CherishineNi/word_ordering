All AFP Gigaword files are treated as a single concatenated file and the lines are sampled without replacement from all lines without regard to file boundaries.

For replication purposes, afp_900k_key.txt contains a name of each file followed by the line numbers (indexed from 0) of that file included in the sample. Blank lines, if any, are not included when counting line numbers.
