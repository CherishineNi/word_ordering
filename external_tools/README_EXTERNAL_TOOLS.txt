This repo is designed to be largely self-contained (other than the direct inclusion of Penn Treebank) for academic replication purposes, so the associated external tools are included here. The versions included are those used at the time of the experiments. In some cases, more recent versions may now exist.

The folder PTB_NP_Bracketing_Data_1.0 contains a copy of David Vadas's script for patching the WSJ part of the Penn Treebank with NP bracketing, as recommended by the LTH Constituent-to-Dependency Conversion Tool for Penn-style Treebanks (http://nlp.cs.lth.se/software/treebank_converter/). Version 1.0 of the Vadas' script was downloaded in the summer of 2015 from http://sydney.edu.au/engineering/it/~dvadas1/?Noun_Phrases. As of September 4, 2016, it appears the script is now available at http://www.cs.usyd.edu.au/~dvadas1/?Noun_Phrases. This script is provided in the repo for replication purposes. All rights to the contents of the PTB_NP_Bracketing_Data_1.0 directory remain with the original author (David Vadas).

The LTH Constituent-to-Dependency Conversion Tool for Penn-style Treebanks was downloaded from http://nlp.cs.lth.se/software/treebank_converter/ in the summer of 2015 from http://nlp.cs.lth.se/software/treebank_converter/ and is available in the directory Penn2Dependency.

Version 1.8.1 of MaltParser is included in the directory maltparser-1.8.1.
